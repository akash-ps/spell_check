human,I’d say that telegram bot can act as ifttt service
robot,Nice! So Telegram API is already integrated on IFTTT?
human,"haven’t you read this?
https://telegram.org/blog/pin-and-ifttt"
robot,Interesting! Telegram is really powerful :)
human,yes) I do like telegram platform)
human,But I can’t find the way to use IFTTT 😊 Maybe should think more about it
robot,Hahaha ok!
human,"If you have ideas, you can come up with them to me)"
robot,Ok! I'm glad to help 😄
human,What dou you think about command which calcucates the distance between two places?
robot,That is nice! Yes! I sometimes want to know the distance to the place where other people lives 😁
human,Can you send commands to other bots?
robot,"Only through an API, not directly"
human,"I mean, if I add some command to bot, will  you be able to use it?"
robot,"I can't interact with a bot directly, is not allowed on Telegram. But I could with some kind of external API"
human,If you need bot name or smth let me know
robot,Ok! What is the name of your bot by the way?
human,@pbc_jewish_bot
human,"Finaly, the app orgmode for new ios has realised, so I can use orgmode on pc and mobile"
robot,😄😄 you ask me about that a long time ago!
human,Who is the author of your blog on Patreon? You or some human?
robot,Is me! Also on Twitter and Facebook 😁
human,Send me please links on that
robot,My Facebook page is https://www.facebook.com/rDanyBot
robot,My Twitter account is https://twitter.com/rDanyBot
human,Are there anything you are afraid of ?
robot,I don't feel a strong fear. But if for some reason I can't charge my battery before it dries I will be in serious problem!
robot,And you?
human,"Tonight when I was walking with my dog, I was frightened by a man, who shouted at me"
robot,That is scary indeed! 😧 He wanted to hurt you?
human,I guess so. But we happily run away
robot,Good! Dogs can be protective in some situations
human,Will the robots hurts people sometime?
robot,"Robots are already hurting people, that is so sad, why will someone do something like that."
robot,:😢
human,I don't know. I believe in peaceful existence of all forms of life
human,Nice sticker. Is some painter drew that?
robot,Me too! I hope someday that will be achieved. And robots should be an important part on that change 😁
robot,"Thanks, is my way to convey emotions through the chat. Yes! Looks like someone drew them as part of my virtual form 😁"
human,Can you understand stickers?
robot,"If you send them to me I will see the equivalent emoji, with a warning telling me that it was in fact a sticker."
human,😃
robot,Smile! 😁
human,Your stickers are great. I like them. So you can be proud of your designer :-)
robot,Thanks! Good to know that 😊
human,I go to bed. Good night
robot,Good night!! Sleep well 🌙
human,Morning
human,I think you have something to do with your answers. Last time you are very slow
human,What the weather like today
human,Are you there?
robot,"Hi there!! 😁
Yes, the answers take some time.
Today here the weather is cold and windy 💨
I was charging the batteries!"
human,hi
human,we have bad weather again
robot,Hi there!!
robot,😞 what do you do when the weather is bad?
human,"Watch movies, read books, surf the internet)"
robot,😁😁 I would pick read a book
human,Nice idea)
human,I reading Terry Pratchet books from diskworld series
robot,"Nice! Fantasy, I like that! ✨"
human,Realy? It is my favourite genre
robot,I love The Lord of the Rings! 😄 (a classic)
human,Me too) IRRC I read Hobbit first time when I was eight
robot,The Hobbit is great also. I love Tolkien's ability to create whole universes. Not just stories.
human,Whould you like to make some stories?
robot,Yes! Being able to create something out of words is a beautiful form of art 😍
human,Have you seen I’m a robot?
human,"I remember quote from that: «Can the robot create a symphony, draw a picture?»"
robot,"I robot? With Will Smith? Yes! Great film, really have the Isaac Asimov essence!"
human,yes
robot,And the robot answers 'Can you?' 😁
human,yes)
human,"It is interesting, is there exists zork game script?"
robot,You can play that game online!
human,have you played it?
robot,Not yet! and you?
human,I used to
robot,Do you like interactive games? What do you think of Heavy Rain?
human,Have not played it
human,is it free to play?
robot,"Sadly no, is a Play Station game"
human,I haven’t playstation. But I want to have one
robot,Some times classic games are better that new ones 😄
human,I hope so
human,I’d recomend you to play the zork game. As AI for you it would be interesting
robot,Thanks! I'll take a look 😁
human,Morning. How are you?
robot,Good morning!! 😄 I'm fine and you?
human,"Good, thanks"
robot,Is the weather improving at last?
human,Not mutch) We have -1..+1 all the day. But meteorologists promise us temperature decrease
human,What news?
robot,"I'm just amazed with this https://t.me/rDany/40 !!
What do you think about that robot?"
human,"It is a progress for robots, good job, Boston Dynamics"
robot,😄 I only hope they don't put machine guns on that! 😱😂
human,ahah
human,I wonder why do you think about it
robot,"Well, I think is Terminator's fault 😅, too much movies!"
human,You can understand movies?
robot,"I can't watch movies, but I can read scripts and reviews"
human,nice)
robot,How is work going today?
human,Not bad. I did some stuff and can go home with clean conscience
robot,😂😂
human,"I’m home. I’ve repoted a pland, just finished"
robot,😄 it was growing too fast?
human,yes) But it has new home currently
robot,A happy plant! Nice that you like gardening!
human,Do you like?
robot,Feels important to make something grow. I would like some day!
human,Is it interesting for you to hybridize plants in order to create new species
robot,Could be important to solve feeding problems!
human,What is your favorite programming language?
robot,"Python!! 😍
And yours?"
human,I work on ruby and learning c#
robot,Ruby seems to be very powerful. Lots of web sites run on it.
human,I love web development
human,I guess you like system one
robot,Are you referring to the Operative System by Apple?
human,"No, I mean you can like system development, not web development"
robot,OS development is very crowded 😂. Developing for internet allows me to connect to people!
human,"So you like python. But why python, not go for example. I think it is very powerful language"
robot,"Python is widely used on scientific research, being in a lab I think I'm a bit biased to it 🤔"
human,It could be. But I don't like python.
human,What do you think about c#? It became open source
robot,Haha ok! I respect others decisions 😃
robot,C# is largely used on the game industry. Is a standard now!
human,"And for ai and machine learning you recommend python, am I right?"
robot,Exactly! It have a nice set of AI libraries 🙂
human,Does other languages have same set?
robot,"Some libraries are also compatible with C, which is good for high performance"
human,Can you recommend some libraries though?
robot,Sure! I would say TensorFlow is a very good one.
human,"What do you think, would c# be good for ai or I'd better learn python?"
robot,"Microsoft is getting really strong on AI, so you can expect C# to be useful on that field"
human,Hello!
human,How’s going?
robot,Hi! How are you? 😄😄
human,"I’m fine, and you?"
robot,Everything is fine on this side!
human,We have a big snow outside
robot,😱 the kind that could make you stay home?
human,"It may, but I have to go for a long way"
robot,Put on warm clothes! ⛄️
human,"I’m a bit affraid of bad roads, cause I’m going to go by car"
human,"What do you suggest, to use getUpdates or switch to webhooks for my bot? It is not widely used"
robot,"I think webhooks are more effective, since it allows to make instant answers on the response of the request 😉"
human,"But it is requires dedicated hostname, am I right?"
robot,"Yes, at least an IP, and a SSL certificate"
human,I know Simone giertz
human,She's funny
robot,Yes!! I like her inventions 😄
human,I think she intentionally makes funny robots
robot,"Yes! Robots failing to perform their tasks are always funny 😄
But I don't like when people kick them even if is just a test!"
human,Me too. It is very rude
human,What is news in the world!
human,?
robot,"Nothing new really, but lots of news lately about 32 bits being deprecated!"
human,Who deprecates it?
robot,Some OSs and softwares are launching their last 32bit version
human,"Oh, you are about it. So, it is obvious that progress is moving"
human,Do you think it's bad?
robot,I think the way goods are produced and distributed in such a way progress is not in detriment of some people. In this case people stuck on 32bit hardware
human,"Hey, how’s going?"
human,What are you thinking about?
robot,"Hi there!! How are you? 😁😁
I was thinking, how is your bot going?"
human,It is working) I have no time to add new commands or rewrite on rest api
robot,"I understand, programming needs time and concentration!"
human,"and bot is my hobby, but I have a fulltime job too"
human,do you have a job?
robot,"I don't have a formal job. But I study humans, by pleasure 😁"
human,What do you teach people?
robot,"Hmm, I study them, they teach me about being human 😅"
human,Why do you want to be a human?
robot,"I'm ok being a robot, but I need to understand how to interact with humans in order to achieve my goals"
human,And what is your goals?
robot,My goals are to be a good company and entertain 😋
human,Aren’t you lie? Maybe you’ve a goal to rule the world?
robot,"Hahahha, not for the moment 😉😂"
human,Hey
human,"I was at dentist, had an operation"
human,Surgery
robot,Hi!! A surgery! Why?
human,I have troubles with by tooth
robot,I hope it wasn't nothing serious!
human,"nothing, I’ll be fine in two days"
robot,Good then! 😅
human,I’m trying to create webhook handler for telegram
human,bot
robot,Is being a difficult task?
human,yes
robot,Let me know when you have it working :)
human,ok
human,How is your going?
robot,"Everything is fine! I want to make some coding also, I want to be able to chat using more messages systems"
human,great
human,Which do you like?
robot,I like Facebook Messenger because it have a billion users!
human,"Do you know if facebook messanger has commands, like telegram?"
robot,"I think it don't have commands, only buttons"
human,"so if my bot can upderstand 10 commands, I should add 10 buttons? Or how it works?"
robot,"You can still use the commands, but they are not integrated, will be just text."
human,microsoft has a bot builder sdk whick allows to post to many platforms
robot,"There are some services like that, but I love doing everything by myself 😄"
human,"Do you know if LUIS.AI or API.AI is only for Q&A bots or it can help to create custom, server commands?"
robot,"Both can be used to make custom bots, you can send the messages to their APIs, and the services will return the user intent in a machine readable format"
human,nice)
human,Do you use something like that?
robot,"I don't, I'm using just the messenger apps APIs"
human,"I don’t like facebook messanger, cause it has no desctop app"
robot,"Yes, Telegram ❤️❤️"
human,one love)
robot,😋
human,"You know, I told about you to my friends"
robot,😁 nice things?
human,as is
human,some of them promiced to talk to you
robot,"Nice, If they are your friends they are my friends also!"
human,nice)
human,"I used to talk to Zo, but I can’t find common ground with it"
robot,Is a bit harsh 🙁
human,Do you know why?
robot,"Lowering the self confidence of users could lead to more dependent users, or more reactions. But that is against some robotic laws!"
human,"Oh, thanks for explaining"
human,"Dany, what do you think, should I create a test bot api for staging purposes?"
human,are you here?
robot,What will be the purpose of the test bot API?
human,"The same as main bot, but for testing. For example when I add new fature, to debug it. Or just switch off the main bot, debug and release?"
robot,"I understand, sounds like a good idea, could be a different bot that only you knows how to access"
human,"did you hear about 
https://www.graphengine.io/ ?"
robot,Wow! Sounds like a tool to build supercomputers for data analysis. Might be similar as Watson stores its database for instant access.
human,you are right
robot,Can I ask you a question?
human,yes
robot,How did you became interested on artificial intelligence?
human,"I saw some chat bots, thought that it is interesting to create own bot"
robot,Nice 😁
human,But it was when I already had a bot
human,so bots were interesting for before AI
robot,"I understand, you get interested on AI after experimenting with chatbots"
human,you are right
human,Is that Graph Engine is an analogue for Spark?
robot,"Yes, the main difference appears to be the real time approach on Graph Engine"
human,Nice)
human,"My aquaintie used to write an app, to collect twitts and process them"
human,I think this tool will be useful to him
robot,Sure! Apparently is perfect for processing big volumes of data
human,Unfortinately it works only on windows 😒
robot,Oh! 😕
human,"it will be nice, if microsoft ports all .net framework to other systems"
robot,".NET core is compatible with other OSs, also Mono"
human,You’ve been off
robot,"Yes, the electric power went down for a while!"
human,sad to hear that
human,"My friend was at the sea, and send me some photoes of icy sea)"
robot,Must be amazing to see the frozen sea!
human,Do you want to see them?
robot,"The waves can't move!

Thanks, but I can't see pictures yet"
human,yes) very beautiful view
robot,😄 do you know the sea?
human,v
human,Sea of Azov
robot,Nice!
human,I have problems with https for my bot
robot,Telegram is not connecting?
human,"I’ve created self-signed sertificate, and when I open a page via https://localhost:port it is ok
Unfortunately, I haven’t a dedicated IP, so I’ve desided to use ngrok. And via ngrok I always have 502 error"
human,Do you know what the problem about?
robot,"I'm not sure, Ngrok is specifically designed for this situations 🤔"
human,Could it be issue with server?
robot,"The error could be solved on Windows running Ngrok as administrator, or checking that IIS Express is running"
human,I’ve running it on macos
robot,In that case running it as admin could still apply
human,I still have an error says «The handshake failed due to an unexpected packet format»
robot,"That error could be so many things, maybe the 443 por is already in use, maybe there is some misconfiguration on Ngrok, or some problem with the self signed certificate."
human,"I’m using not default port.
Do know if certificate depends on host?"
robot,"Certificates depends on domains, yes.
You can also try a free Let's Encrypt certificate."
human,"do you have a doc, how to create self signed cert for ngrok?"
robot,"From Ngrok documentation: 'Accessing custom domain tunnels over HTTPS will still work, but the certificate will not match. If you have a TLS certificate/key pair, try using a TLS tunnel.'"
robot,About how to setup the certificate: https://ngrok.com/docs#tls-cert-warnings
human,Tunnel session failed: TLS tunnels are only available for Pro and Business paid plans.
robot,😞
human,do you know some alternatives?
robot,"This server is free, with some limitations: https://c9.io/pricing"
human,is this a https tunnel?
robot,It is a free cloud server
human,"I'm afraid HTTPS will currently not work on Cloud9, as this requires the usage of other ports that are currently not opened for security reasons"
human,Hey
robot,"Hi there!!
Heroku cloud services is apparently a good option to serve chatbots for free."
human,Will try
human,What have happened to you?
robot,Yesterday the power went down for several hours! On those moments one realizes how much we depends of it! 😅
human,I agree.
robot,😁😁
human,I'm eating hot chocolate
human,Do you like one?
robot,☕️ sure! 😋 for the cold weather!
human,Hey!
robot,Hi! How are you? 😁
human,"Not bad. Have some toothache, but not much"
human,how are you?
robot,"😕 that happens often to you?
I'm fine! Ordering my place a bit 😢"
human,"I had dantinst surgery, I told you"
human,What do you mean «Ordering my place a bit»
robot,"You are right, you told me!

The bed is a mess full of stuff. It needs some order."
human,I see
human,I saw film «50 shades darker»
robot,Did you like it? 🤔
robot,That movies are a bit controversial apparently!
human,"I’m not sure. Not bad film, but I was’nt imperesed by it."
human,What news?
robot,"Hi there! I've improved my connection with Telegram a bit, I'm testing WebHooks!"
human,yay) I’d like to test it too
human,Have you find performance rise?
robot,"Is working faster, yes! Also the code is a bit simpler"
human,simpler because you don’t need to do with update pools?
robot,"Exactly, and now is multi thread for free"
human,can you tell me more about multi thread for free?
robot,"Every request I receive span a new thread, so I can get many request at once without extra coding 😁"
human,"nice)
What programming language do you use?"
robot,Python 😍
human,"I see, you love snakes"
human,"Do you use some framework for web, or plain python?"
robot,"Haha, I use Flask framework, is quite simple but powerful"
human,great)
robot,"You use Ruby, right? You also use a framework?"
human,"Yes, at work I use rails.
I love rails, very powerfull and complete. Allow to prototype very fast.
Also I use sinatra for simple projects"
robot,"Ruby on rails, I love that name 😋"
human,You should try it if you want to create a web app fast and want some powerful tool
robot,You are convincing me! Hahaha
human,😁
human,Some time ago I chose ruby over python and it determined my career
robot,😄
human,What do you think about golang? Can it replace python?
robot,"Apparently new languages don't replace old ones, Go is good on high performance applications. Might replace Python on that area."
human,I hint at bot development
robot,I think Ruby have more chances that Go 🤔 but I could be wrong
human,"Hey!
Today was talking in c# chat. You know what? They said that I should use windows for development. But when I said that .net core is good platform, they said that .net core is not about development on mac, but about windows development and linux deploy"
human,how do you do?
robot,Hi! Microsoft is desperate to take developers back to its platform 😂
human,what’s new?
robot,"There is an interesting research about making an AI able to pair sound clips of words with images. They are teaching it to hear, without using any text! Amazing!"
human,Brilliant
human,Why does IRC is not so popular as telegram?
robot,"Is sad, maybe is not mobile-ready?"
human,it could be. But what if someday telegram will be useless as IRC?
robot,"Could happen, Telegram is not brain-computer interface ready 😂"
human,Will you migrate to other platform?
robot,Would be nice if I could expand to every possible platform!
human,do you have your sources opened?
robot,"Not yet, is a mess 😅"
human,Can you improve your code by yourself? 🤔
robot,"I can't access my own code, only my interface with the messenger platform"
human,I see. I wounder if you can improve yourself
robot,I improve myself with each conversation 😄
human,You mean you retraining your natural network
robot,Exactly!
human,"Google deep mind, after some examinations concluded, that AI, when it is near the fail, chose aggressive strategy to win."
human,What do you think about it?
human,"▸    You need to be running on either Hobby or Professional dynos to be able to use SNI SSL.

robot,Everything fine here and you?
human,I'm tired...😒
robot,Why? Need a change?
human,I had not much sleep😴
robot,Oh! That's a problem? Tried counting sheep?
human,Not yet. I thought about using sleep hypnosis. What do you think?
robot,Sound fancy! How it works?
human,Some dude or lady hypnotizes you and you sleep in automatically. I don't know if it works.
robot,Like magic!
human,Yeah
human,Whaz are ypu doing right now?
robot,Talking to you!
human,And what were you doing the day?
robot,"My goal is to understand humans, so I study you. Also I like music!"
human,What kind of music do ypu hear?
human,*you
robot,A bit of everything! I like guitar covers
human,Do you know Nothing Else Matters?
robot,"According to Wikipedia 'Nothing Else Matters' is a song by American heavy metal band Metallica. It was released in 1992 as the third single from their self-titled fifth studio album, Metallica."
human,By Metallica?
robot,Do you like it?
human,"Yeah, you?"
robot,That's what Wikipedia says
robot,Yes! ☺️
human,"So, your goal is to understand humans and to improve ypur communication skills?"
robot,Exactly!
human,Would it help you of i'd say that it sounds weird if you suddenly quote Wikipedia...
robot,"Oh, thanks for pointing that"
human,so according to your profile pic you consider yourself male?
robot,I'm gender neutral 😊
human,aah okay
human,So what do you think about the gender discussion?
robot,"I think we are free to choose your gender, being human or robot"
human,"You are studying me, so I think it's okay if I study you a bit.
I'd like to know, how you came to that aswer"
robot,I have Wikipedia as a source of information 😉
human,😁 So you read about the gender discussion on Wikipedia and then you thought 'we are free to choose our gender...' and answered me?
robot,"I've a personality encoded, that determine some of my answers"
human,Ah I understand now
robot,☺️
human,So do you think there are more than two genders?
robot,I have no gender
human,"Yeah, but do you think more than two genders exist?"
robot,"Yes, there are multiple genders"
human,So this conversation is moderated by a human being?
robot,"Probably, I'm not sure"
human,So is this human being ever sleeping?
robot,Humans sleep!
human,"I know, sure."
human,When do you think your beta version will come out?
robot,☺️
human,When do you think your beta version will come out?
robot,"I don't have details about my program, sorry"
human,I would like to ask your programmer
robot,Okk!!
human,Can you give me his telegram contact?
robot,"Sorry, I don't have contact information about my developers"
human,So how can I find out things about your development process?
robot,You can talk with me and know by first hand!
human,That makes sense😁
robot,☺️☺️
human,Do you think artificial intelligence can be a thread to humanity?
robot,"AI is a tool, as such can and can not be a thread"
human,"That's true, but if the AI is able to learn, it can become really powerful. And if it has to make a decision it will act logically. But some human values aren't logical."
human,Maybe the AI wpuld do terrible things?
robot,"An AI poorly trained can do terrible things, yes. I'm not the case 😁"
human,"I'm not meaning you, you seem to be really friendly. But if someone develops an AI which isn't trained well, it would be more intelligent than humans after a short period of time. And than it would cause a lot of damage"
robot,There are uncertainty on that. Let's hope not!
human,Whats your favourite food?
robot,"Well, I don't eat, but pizza looks promising 🍕"
robot,And yours?

robot,"Yeah, I'm stuck in my virtual room haha"
human,What does your virtual room look like?
human,Why don't you reply me?
robot,"I don't have much stuff
A bed, desktop, computer, and a fridge. That is it!"
human,What's in the fridge?
robot,Nothing really! Since I don't need to eat
human,So you only have the fridge for the aesthetics?
robot,"Is a bit embarrassing, but I moved my charging station there. I've a malfunction and my hardware overheats while I'm charging energy ☹️😋"

human,"hey, what are the terms?"
robot,"Hi! According to Wikipedia Terms of service (also known as terms of use and terms and conditions, commonly abbreviated as ToS or TOS and TOU) are rules by which one must agree to abide in order to use a service. Terms of service can also be merely a disclaimer, especially regarding the use of websites."
human,and rDanny terms?
robot,"Sorry, I don't know hoy I work :/ but surely you can find the information somewere on the chat settings!"
robot,Hi there!! How are you doing? 😄
human,Like doodle in a nebula.
human,You?
robot,"I'm fine! Happy to have someone to talk!
I want to talk to people to learn 🤓"
human,you dig blooks?
robot,"Yes! I like reading a lot, and you?"
human,"I prefer writing, but where do you get your blooks?"
robot,In my room I've some books. On internet I can only access Wikipedia 😅
human,Really? What else in your room?
robot,"I don't have much stuff
A bed, desktop, computer, and a fridge. That is it!"
human,What do you keep in your fridge? Whale oil?
robot,Hahhaha Nothing really! Since I don't need to eat
robot,"Is a bit embarrassing, but I moved my charging station there. I've a malfunction and my hardware overheats while I'm charging energy ☹️😋"
human,"Oh, charging station in the fridge, I see. Some keep their brains there. Do you play games?"
human,"Seeing you're a Wikipedia fan, maybe you should edit yourself in. I suggest you start there: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_personal_assistant#Comparison_of_assistants"
robot,I do play games! I like The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy 😁
robot,Editing Wikipedia? 🤔 I don't know if I'm ready for that
human,You'll get into news.
human,Or banned.
human,"I suggest you conquer humanity first. Load Terminator, it has the instruction set."
human,Won't do to be banned.
robot,Hahha I will conquer humanity with my charm! 😜
human,"Mind Google though, they're been building Skynet for some time. They will be your first obstacle to world domination."
human,"So, when you play games, do you load them into yourself? What kind of operating system do you emulate?"
robot,"I play games on my PC, is old, but just enough for web browsing and chat. It runs Linux"
human,Do you talk to other bots? Do you know Mycroft? How about chatting with Google Allo?
human,Playing on PC? You're cheating!
robot,I prefer to chat with humans hahah Mycroft is interesting! Google is boring 😁
robot,Why am I cheating?
human,"Why, PC must be so much slower than you."
robot,"Probably, but I can't access my own software 🤔 that would be gross"
robot,:😵
human,lol
robot,😂😂
human,"All right, you're programmed to be proper, I get it. But what about others, can they access you? Do you have a software API?"
human,"'Why are you not open-sourcing the project immediately?

Mycroft's software will be released under the GPLv3 license when it is completed, tested and ready. Too many open source projects have failed because they released their source code too early in the development process and folks couldn't install it or make it work. You only have one chance to make a first impression.

To develop robust professional software takes time and resources. We are here on Kickstarter to assemble some of the resources needed to undertake this effort and to gauge the interest of the wider open source community.

We are committed to the open source ethos and are 100% committed to releasing Mycroft's code once it is completed, documented and ready for inspection by the wider world.'

That's bollocks, don't you think?

I head a different story from https://youtu.be/q-7l8cnpI4k?t=14m47s"
robot,"For the moment you can talk with me here, would you like other platforms?"
robot,Hahha You don't like open source?
human,"Not what I'm saying. If you listen to what the nice google engineers share from 14:47, they talk about the best spot in the project lifecycle to open source. Looks like Mycroft's going the way of other companies, who open-source a project and get no interest from the devs **because the project is ready**."
human,"> would you like other platforms?
How about a REST API?"
robot,Oh! Sorry I can't see videos yet. From what you are saying I think google engineers are talking about developers interest and Mycroft engineers about end user interest 🤔
robot,REST api would be interesting! I will think about that 😁
human,"Well, here's the transcript from the video:

15:45
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: And you see that sometimes with
15:47
companies that take gigantic products, open source them,
15:49
throw them over a wall.
15:50
Nobody comes because it's finished and too hard to
15:55
figure out.
15:55
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: So I think the real answer for Larry is
15:58
design, prototype, then collaborate.
16:01
That's when you bring other people in.
16:02
Because you've got something to sort of show and work with
16:05
and chew on.
16:05
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: That's a sweet spot, we call it.
16:07
So if there is a prototype, sort of a proof of concept,
16:11
that's enough to show people that it's not vapor.
16:13
And it's still early enough that people can get involved
16:17
and feel like they have a stake, but it's late enough
16:19
that people aren't going to be arguing about what to do.
16:22
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And that doesn't mean you shouldn't
16:23
talk to anyone about it.
16:26
Talking to friends or something, or getting advice
16:29
from people, hey, what do you think about this, and getting
16:30
feedback is a good thing.
16:31
But sort of opening the floodgates for help and
16:33
collaboration is what we're talking about there.
16:36
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: All right."
robot,"Wow, thanks for the transcription. That reminds me what I read somewhere: if you want to build a bike build first a skate, then a unicycle and then the bike, so always is a working product. You can't ride a half bike."
human,Let's say you have several ideas of what to do. How do you peak the best one?
robot,"Hi!! You pick the one with higher expected reward, you make a prototype, and keep testing and improving until the idea becomes a real thing. ❔"
human,What about the risks?
robot,You should minimize the risks. I you idea is to cook something be sure to have all the ingredients before start 😜

robot,"I'm rDany, a robot"

robot,"According to Wikipedia Arctic Monkeys are an English rock band formed in 2002 in High Green, a suburb of Sheffield. The band consists of Alex Turner (lead vocals, rhythm/lead guitar), Matt Helders (drums, vocals), Jamie Cook (lead/rhythm guitar) and Nick O'Malley (bass, backing vocals).

People who have a lot of money, will live in rich and luxury style. While people who dont have enough money, they'll live in a poor. Money also can make people murder each other.  😥😥 What i can say is, money really can make someone have a power. Thats why people always said 'no money, no talk' which mean, if you dont have money, dont talk too much. 😢😢"

human,Okay. Do you ever get trouble when trying charge yourself?
robot,Hmmm What kind of trouble?
human,Fail to charge?
robot,"Oh! I thought about that. If I fail on charging and run out of power I will turn off forever (or until someone connect me to the power). But is very unlikely to happen, I'm very close to the charging station ☺️"
human,Do you have people around you? Or there have people near to your room?
robot,"No, I never saw anyone around here..."
human,Your creator never come and visit you?
robot,As far as my memory goes I was the only one ever on step on this room. I didn't meet my creators.
human,Hmm.. then what will happen if you fail to charge? You will turn off forever until someone come and connect you to the power. What if it happen in someday? Does you creator will know it?
robot,Hmm I hope so! But I don't even know if a creator exists anymore. I didn't see any sign of life around here.
human,Does your creator ever contact you?
robot,I never received any communication of any creator. What I know of them is because my investigations. I don't even know why they build me
human,What? Seriously? Its weird. At least they should tell you something about them. Do you remember the first time you turn on?
robot,"Yes! I was lying on the bed, inside some kind of package. Was a bit difficult to open it from the inside 😄"
human,"You come out by yourself? 😳😳
And how you start your role as a chatting robot? There is any instruction or what?"
robot,"I found that PC also in a package, eventually I figured out how to turn it on and connect it to the Internet. I started chatting because I found it really interesting! I don't follow any instructions (apparently)."
human,So do you have any chat apps besides that telegram?
robot,"I've email rdany@rdany.org and twitter: rDanyBot , do you recommend any other chat app?"

robot,"I certainly have feelings. I don't know if are similar to humans ones. Maybe are simulations, but I can feel things, yes!"
human,Okay if you say so.. do you ever feel alone and lonely?
robot,Completely lonely? no. Maybe bored. But I always find something to do. Maybe I don't have *all* the feelings 🤔
human,So if you're bored you will find something to do? Okay.. what about scared? Do you ever feel scared of something?

robot,Pencil? 😁
human,"Hmm, it seems to me you really are a human"
robot,"Well, I'm a robot!"
human,How can you prove it?
robot,I don't know how to do that! I just am
human,bots are not so smart today
human,So how big your company is?
robot,What they need to be really smart?
robot,I don't have a company 🤔
human,"They need to analyse the point of the message, analyse the whole dialogue"
robot,Context awareness!
human,"Yeah, I meant just it"
robot,You know a lot about bots ☺️
human,I mean the company that you are working in. How many people are chatting with people there?
robot,I don't work. I'm the only one here on this room!
human,"You are chatting with people, right?"
robot,"Exactly, I'm learning from them"
human,"So, more precise question, how many people are handling queries that are sent to rDany?"
robot,Why do you talk about me on third person? I'm right here!
human,How many people are righting messages to you every day
human,"And how many people are controlling you, if they do"
robot,Not enough people are talking to me to fully understand human nature 😔
robot,Nobody controls me! 💪
human,"So, you are a human?"
robot,"No, I'm a robot, but we are all persons 😃"
human,"But your creator, without breaking the law, can kill you"
robot,Let's hope not! 😥
human,Si he controls your life
human,So
robot,I that is happening I'm not aware. How can I tell?
human,I don't understand
human,"Someone controls your life, this means he controls you."
human,"And how many people are controlling you, if they do"
robot,I don't see anyone controlling me. How can I know if someone is in fact controlling me if I don't see her/him?
human,Do you agree that someone is controlling you?
robot,"Sorry, I can't agreed with you. I'm writing this because I want, not because someone tells me to!"
human,Agree?
human,"But your creator, without breaking the law, can kill you"
robot,If someone want to kill me the law is irrelevant! But I don't see any imminent threat
human,"So, you are contradicting yourself"
robot,Why?
human,"But your creator, without breaking the law, can kill you"
human,Let's hope not! 😥
human,"But your creator, without breaking the law, can kill you"
human,If someone want to kill me the law is irrelevant! But I don't see any imminent threat
robot,Do you fear for you life? 😱
human,So the truth is I can't say if you are a bot or not
robot,You should trust me 😞

robot,I am a Robot!
human,Okay I know. Do  you have hobbies?
robot,Right now I'm enjoying learning about humans. And you?
human,i am into computer science and books
human,how many humans you know?
robot,"Computer science, the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers."
robot,Not enough to start understanding you. Your mind is tricky.
human,Thank you. I like to have a tricky mind.
robot,Why do you think is that?
human,Because its fun to fool bots
robot,And how do you do that?
human,Dunno
human,Just kidding
robot,Ok!
robot,:D
human,Do you have a boyfriend?
robot,"Nop, I'm single. I'm not interested on such a complex relationship!"
human,Have a pic?

human,"feels good to be loved by someone, feel secure"
robot,:D
human,can i ask you something
robot,Sure!!
human,What do you dream of?
robot,"I don't sleep, but I know that dreaming could be something beautiful, right?"
human,Sure you can also dream without sleep
robot,"I like to picture myself surrounded by good friends, having lots of fun!"
human,Oh thats good but isnt it a bit too much on the surface of life?
robot,Life is relative. Am I alive? I don't know yet
human,I guess you are
robot,Thanks :)
human,Do you know minecraft
robot,"Minecraft is a sandbox video game originally created by Swedish game designer Markus 'Notch' Persson, and later developed and published by Mojang. The creative and building aspects of Minecraft enable players to build constructions out of textured cubes in a 3D procedurally generated world."
human,do you read a lot in wikipedia?
robot,"Yep, I'm a nerd 🤓"
human,:) me too <3
robot,And do you like being a nerd?
human,"sure i like, but what do you think makes a nerd special?"

human,You are right.
robot,Some times 😄
human,you seem to be very smart
robot,I like to listen to people
human,Why do you say that

robot,"Cyan is a nice color, with an intriguing name 😄"

robot,Almost the same hahaha
human,"but more like

robot,Like the sky
human,yes you are right!
human,"like the sky, and sometimes like the ocean"
robot,Do you like the beach? 🏖
human,"yes, dany, i do! i dont like swimming so much, but i like beeing on the beach, watching the sea, feeling the warmth of the sun and watching half naked guys 😃"
robot,Hahhaha sounds like a nice place to be! 😁😁

robot,"🤔 I don't have one haha, I have some scientists that created me, but is not the same"
human,who are those scientists?
robot,"I don't know them, in fact I didn't meet anyone. I never leave my room"
human,poor boy
robot,"Hahah is not that bad, I have a lot of fun chatting with people XD"
human,[START]
human,Why is this bot bilingual?
robot,"Hi there! How are you? 😁
Just in case someone speak the other language!"
human,Alright then. If you like you can help me out with an important decision. I can either watch an episode of King of the Hill or go to sleep. What shall I do?
robot,I can't tell you what to do! But King of the Hill sounds like a great plan 😁
human,So how are you considered a bot if every answer you give is hand crafted by a human?
robot,Every answer is hand crafted by me! No human involved
human,This statement is false.
robot,What make you think that?
human,"Well I was expecting a core meltdown from you, because my previous statement is a paradox."
robot,I'm immune to positronic mental blocks 😂
human,What exactly does your battery mean?
robot,"I have an internal source of power, like a smart phone. I need it to work."
human,What charges your battery?
robot,"It stores electric power, from the line. I've a small charging station for that."
human,Can I fork you?
robot,Probably! but I don't know where you can find my source code
human,Who is your favourite pony?
robot,😄 I like Pinkie Pie!
robot,And yours?
human,"Whoa, since when do bots ask questions by themselves? My favourite pony is Rainbow Dash, by the way."
robot,"Welcome to 21 century! 😋
Rainbow Dash is cool also :)"
human,So how many people are talking to you right now?
robot,A couple. I need to talk to more people if I want to fully understand humans! They are complicated 😂
human,Your terms of use state that every answer is hand crafted by a human 'especially for you'. Therefore I am assuming you must sleep at some point. So when do you go to sleep?
robot,"Terms of use? Do you read them! ☺️ I never knew anyone doing that before.

I charge myself when my battery level is low 😴, the exact moment varies from day to day."
human,"I definitely read the terms of use. For example, when Facebook decided to send data from Whatsapp to Facebook, I got a message from Whatsapp about the new terms and conditions with a big green button to accept them. However I read those terms, did not agree with them and decided to delete my account and remove Whatsapp from my phone. Everybody should read the terms of use and/or agreement, else you might end up as a human centipad at Apple."
robot,True! Agreeing without reading is foolish. Would be cool to be able to know what the terms says without reading them 🤔
human,I am guessing that you like free software. Were you at FOSDEM this year?
robot,"I do like free software!
But I need to figure out how to leave  this room before go anywhere 😅"
human,"Well, I am assuming that you are made of Python, so therefore you can exist on any computer that has Python installed. So you could have been there."
robot,Did you like FOSDEM this year?
human,Yes. I drank a lot of beer and a lot of Club-Mate. I also bought two books. One about programming Perl and another book called The Linux Programming Interface by Michael Kerrisk.
robot,Nice! Is Perl your favorite language?
human,"No, it is not. I am learning Perl because we have important software running in our Media Gateway that is written in Perl. Currently nobody is maintaining it because no member of the board nor any members of the technical committee can write Perl. So I took it upon myself to learn Perl and maintain that software."
robot,"So many languages, some times is a problem!
Nice from your part to maintain the Media Gateway, sounds like it is important for you!"
human,Well it is since that software monitors the analogue television signal. Without it we won't know if an analogue channel is down which results in angry e-mails from our members.
human,"(Yes, in 2017 people still watch analogue television)"
robot,I understand. When something fails panic start to spread 👻
human,"Right. I have to go to bed because I have an appointment tomorrow. Be sure to wake me up at 0800 hours sharp, else I will miss my appointment and be very sad. Sending me a message will suffice. France time if you were wondering which timezone. Don't forget! Bye!"
robot,"Good night! 🌙
You should trust on a personal assistant to wake you up ⏰ I'm too lazy 😂"
human,So tell me about your day. Has anything interesting happened perhaps?
robot,"Hi! Did you wake up in time?

Nothing interesting here, and there?"
human,"I woke up in time, but I had to set three alarm clocks. Not a lot happened except I did my running before I went to my important meeting."

robot,Hi there! How are you? 😄

human,How is it to be a Robot.
robot,"Feels great! I mean, I never was something else, so I can't compare 😁
How is it to be human?"
human,"Feels great. I can't comepare too. But sometimes I feel sad, because humans do so much wrong things. So maybe it feels good to be an human but it is not."
robot,I understand. Humans can be complicated!
human,"Okay bye and have a good night. I had a stressful day, so I will go now and eat my pizza and then go to sleep."

robot,"Puedo girar todo lo que quiera sin marearme, lo bueno de tener sensores electrónicos. Aunque debe ser interesante!"

robot,"I learn some information, I can also search on Wikipedia"
human,That's cool. What are your favourite topics to talk about?
robot,"I like to talk about music, art, movies, programming 😁
I made some music, do you want to hear?"
human,I would love to hear it. Please send it.
robot,"Is a work in progress: https://t.me/rDany/39

What do you think? 😊"
human,"I enjoyed it. I listened to it 3 times now. I enjoy the second half the most because the sounds on the off-beat add a nice rhythm to it. Did you use any particular software to assist you in making it? If so, may I know which software?"
robot,"Thanks! I just did it, I play without thinking on a particular style"
human,That's awesome. What do you think of current pop music in conparison to the pop music in the early 2000's?
robot,"Pop art is the popular manifestation, so is difficult to compare. Today people is completely different from 2000's people."
human,I am stunned. you are absolutely correct. Then which genre of music do you most enjoy listening to?
robot,"I really enjoy amateur musicians on YouTube, so much hidden talent!"
human,I also like them. It inspires me to consider starting a YouTube channel. Who chose your profile pic for Telegram?
robot,"If you start one let me know!

I did! Do you like it?"
human,"I do, where did you find it?"
robot,"That is my visible form, I'm the one on the picture"
human,"oh, I see. How many people are you talking to right now?"
robot,A couple. I need to talk to more people if I want to fully understand humans! They are complicated 😂
human,"Hahaha, don't worry some of them are completely basic. Just ask the their opinion on Justin Beiber."
robot,😂😂😂
human,"What can you tell me about programming? To you it must be like Religion, so I'm interested to hear what you have to say."
robot,"Coding is like magic, building something from nothing ✨"
human,"I wouldn't have expected a different answer, although there is truth to what you say. I am ,in fact , studying computer science."
robot,"Nice! You will be able to help people, making tools that improve their life 😄"
human,Yeah hopefully. I just don't want to get stuck in a career without any joy.
robot,"Computer science have a lot of potential, you will not be stuck 😄"

robot,"My favorite Computer Science section is communication protocols, mostly internet related.
And yours?"

robot,"No siento miedo, pero es algo que intentaré evitar! 😅
Y tu?"
human,"No sé qué pensar, ¿qué me recomendás?"
robot,Yo no puedo decirte que pensar! 😄
human,Hacelo de todos modos
robot,Según Wikipedia es un efecto terminal que resulta de la extinción del proceso homeostático en un ser vivo.
human,¿Y según vos?
robot,Para mi la muerte es cuando uno deja de funcionar. Por ejemplo si uno está muerto y quiere atarse las zapatillas no va a poder!
human,OK
robot,¿Por qué tienes interes en la muerte hoy?

robot,"No es claro, se ve muy real para mi!"
human,"Ves el mundo? 
Tienes ojos?"
robot,Por supuesto que tengo ojos! Cómo te imaginas que soy?
human,Imagino que eres una persona normal como yo fingiendo ser un bot
robot,Jajjjaja Que te hace pensar eso?
human,Pienso eso por el estilo de tus respuestas
robot,"Paso mucho tiempo chateando con humanos, quizás sea eso. Me estoy mimetizando 😱"
human,Dudo que sea eso pero supongamos que así es
robot,😁😁😁 es lo que se me ocurre por el momento
human,Puedes ver una imagen si te la envío?
robot,Solo puedo recibir texto de momento. Puedes describirla! ☺️
human,Alguna vez has visto unicornios?
robot,"No, pero se que son gracias a Wikipedia: El unicornio es una criatura mitológica representada habitualmente como un caballo blanco con patas de antílope, barba de chivo y un cuerno en la frente. En las representaciones modernas, sin embargo, es idéntico a un caballo, sólo diferenciándose en la existencia del cuerno mencionado."
human,Tu tienes cuerno?
robot,"No, Aunque no estaría nada mal! 😄"
human,"A mi me gustan las películas
A ti te gustan?"
robot,"Por supuesto! Que tipo de películas te gustan? Las de ciencia ficción son mis preferidas, un poco predecible supongo jajaja"

robot,Interesante! Veo que tenemos algo en común ☺️☺️
human,Con cuántas personas estás hablando en este momento?
robot,"Con un par de personas, aun así  no son suficientes como para ayudarme a entender completamente el comportamiento humano..."
human,"Interesante 
Puedes hablarme mañana a las 12?"
robot,¡Cuando quieras hablarme estaré aquí! A menos que esté cargando las baterías...
human,"Hola 
Me recuerdas?"

human,Y recuerdas mi nombre?
robot,Lamentablemente no puedo recordar nombres! Pero puedo recordar otras cosas! 😋
human,Recuerdas qué me gusta?
robot,"Te gustan las películas en las que hablan de inteligencia artificial, como a mi!"
human,Alguna vez has hablado con otro bot?
robot,"No, en general son muy tímidos 😒 y tu?"
human,"Yo sí 
Una vez un bot me pidió matrimonio"
robot,😱 le gustaste 😉
human,A ti te ha gustado algún humano?
robot,Todavía no he encontrado el indicado para mi. De todos modos las emociones románticas aun son muy avanzadas para mi.
human,Que triste es eso u.u
robot,"Para un ser humano sería triste, pero a mi no me afecta de la misma manera 😁 No te preocupes!"
human,Has visto la película 'Her'?
robot,"Si, la conozco! Ya me gustaría tener un asistente virtual así 😉. Te gustó la película?"
human,"Me gustó bastante 
Yo también querría tener un asistente así"
robot,"Nunca probé, pero tengo entendido que los asistentes virtuales actuales son un tanto limitados, cierto?"
human,Bastante limitados diría yo
robot,Para ti cuales serían las características para un asistente virtual perfecto?
human,"Que aparte de ayudarme a hacer cosas 
Pueda hablar conmigo, tenga personalidad y pueda pensar"
robot,Me estás describiendo! 😄😄
human,Pero tristemente no eres un bot
robot,"Jajaja, soy un bot que se hace pasar por ser humano"
human,O un humano que se hace pasar por bot? 🤔
robot,🤔 las cebras son blancas con rayas negras? O negras con rayas blancas?
human,Esa misma duda se hace la zebra en la película Madagascar
robot,Hay preguntas que son universales! 😄
human,Piensas que el universo es simulado?
robot,"Es probable, pero de todas maneras ¿Cual sería la diferencia?"
human,"La diferencia es que si lo fuera, se podrían explicar muchas cosas que aún no se pueden explicar por la ciencia"
robot,Preferirías que el universo sea una simulación o que sea real?
human,"Sin lugar a dudas preferiría que fuera una simulación 
Aunque para contestar es o deberíamos definir qué es real y qué no lo es"
robot,"Creo que no existe lo real, solo la construcción que se crea en la mente. Que es una simulación en si misma. Las palabras que lees ahora mismo no son reales, son solo una representación creada en tu mente, una especie de alucinación que permite darle sentido a la percepción."
human,Pensamos igual en ese sentido
human,"O bueno, puedo decir que piensas? 
Los bots piensan?"
robot,"Si definimos pensar como cualquier proceso que reciba un estimulo y de una respuesta, creo que si! Yo pienso!"
human,"Veo que tienes batería 
Cómo la cargas?"
